## Question and Solution

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```sql
select
        s.customer_id,
	sum(price) as total_amount_spent
from sales s
inner join menu m
on s.product_id = m.product_id
group by s.customer_id;
```
**Steps:**

- **INNER JOIN** is used to merge `sales` and `menu` tables on `Product_id` column to combine the matching sales records with menu records.
- Result set of inner join is **GROUP BY** `sales.customer_id` and **SUM( )** is used to calculate the total amount spent by each customer.


**Solution :**
| customer_id | total_amount_spent |
|-------------|-------|
| A           | 76    |
| B           | 74    |
| C           | 36    |

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

```sql
with cte as
   (
	select 
              customer_id,
              order_date
	from sales
	group by
                 customer_id,
		 order_date
   ) 
select 
      customer_id,
      count(order_date) as no_of_days_visited
from cte
group by customer_id;
```
**Steps:**

##### Common Table Expression (CTE):
- **CTE** is used to get unique visit days of each customer by grouping the records by `customer_id` and `order_date` columns.

##### Outer Query:
- Group the result set of CTE by `customer_id` column and **count( )** is used on the grouped records to calculate the total number of days each customer visited.

**Solution :**
| customer_id | no_of_days_visited |
|-------------|--------|
| A           | 4      |
| B           | 6      |
| C           | 2      |

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```sql
select 
      customer_id,
      order_date,
      product_name
from
(
	select
	       s.customer_id,
	       s.order_date,
	       m.product_name,
	       row_number() over(partition by s.customer_id
	       order by s.order_date) as ranks
	from sales s
	inner join menu m
	on s.product_id = m.product_id
) as x
where ranks = 1;
```

**Steps:**

##### Subquery: 
- **INNER JOIN** is used to Combine the `sales` and `menu` tables on `roduct_id` column to get product names for each sale.
- **PARTITION BY** `s.customer_id` creates a separate ranking for each customer and **ORDER BY** `s.order_date` ensures the orders are ranked chronologically.
- **ROW_NUMBER()** window function assigns a unique rank to each order per customer based on the order date.

##### Outer Query:
- **WHERE** Clause selects only the rows where the ranks is 1, which corresponds to the first order for each customer.


**Solution :**
| customer_id | order_date | product_name |           
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| A           | 2021-01-01        |  sushi  |
| B           | 2021-01-01        |  curry  |
| C           | 2021-01-01        |  ramen  |

***

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu?**
```sql
select
       top 1
       m.product_name,
       count(*) as total_purchased
from sales s
join menu m
on s.product_id = m.product_id
group by m.product_name
order by total desc;
```
**Steps:**
- **INNER JOIN** is used to Combine the `sales` and `menu` tables on `product_id` column to get product names for each sale.
- **GROUP BY** Clause groups the results by product name and **COUNT( )** is used to Count the number of times each product was purchased. The result is given an alias `total_purchased` for clarity.
- **ORDER BY** Clause orders the results by the total number of purchases in descending order, so the most purchased product comes first.
- **TOP 1** , Limits the result to the first row, which will be the most frequently purchased product.


**Solution :**
| product_name | total_purchased |
|--------------|-----------|
| ramen        | 8         |

***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```sql
with cte as
(
	select
	       customer_id,
               product_id,
               count(*) as order_count,
               dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id
               order by count(*) desc) as ranks
	from sales
	group by
	         customer_id,
                 product_id
)
select
       c.customer_id,
       c.order_count,
       m.product_name 
from cte c
join menu m
on c.product_id = m.product_id
where ranks = 1;
```

**Steps:**

##### Common Table Expression (CTE):
- **GROUP BY** Clause and **count(*)** helps in determining the order count of each product by each customer.
- **dense_rank( )** assign a rank to each product ordered by each customer based on the order count.

##### Outer Query:
- **INNER JOIN** is used to Combine the `cte` result set and `menu` tables on `product_id` column to get product names for each sale.
- **WHERE** Clause selects only the rows where the ranks is 1, indicating the most frequently purchased product for each customer.

**Solution :**
customer_id|order_count|product_name
---|---|---
A|3|ramen
B|2|sushi
B|2|curry
B|2|ramen
C|3|ramen

***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
with cte as
(
	select
               s.customer_id,
	       s.order_date,
	       s.product_id,
	       ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by s.customer_id
	       order by s.order_date) as ranks
	from sales s
	join members m
	on s.customer_id = m.customer_id
	where s.order_date >= m.join_date
)
select c.customer_id,
       c.order_date,
       m.product_name
from cte c
join menu m
on c.product_id = m.product_id
where ranks = 1;
```
**Steps:**

##### Common Table Expression (CTE):
- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `customer_id` from the `sales` table with the `customer_id` in the `members` table to identify customers who joined as members.
- **WHERE** Clause helps in considering only the orders which are made after a customer's join date as member.
- **ROW_NUMBER()** assigns a unique rank to each order per customer based on the order date.

##### Outer Query:
- **INNER JOIN** is used to Combine the `cte` result set and `menu` tables on `product_id` column to get product names for each sale.
- **WHERE** Clause selects only the rows where the ranks is 1, indicating the first product purchased by each customer after joining as a member.


**Solution :**
customer_id|order_date|product_name
---|---|---
A|2021-01-07|curry
B|2021-01-11|sushi

***

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

```sql
with cte as
(
	select
	       s.customer_id,
	       s.order_date,
	       s.product_id,
	       ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by s.customer_id
	       order by s.order_date) as ranks
	from sales s
	join members m
	on s.customer_id = m.customer_id
	where s.order_date < m.join_date
),
cte1 as
(
	select
	       c.customer_id,
	       c.order_date,
	       m.product_name,
	       ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by c.customer_id
	       order by ranks desc) as ranks1
	from cte c
	join menu m
	on c.product_id = m.product_id
)
select
       ct.customer_id,
       ct.order_date,
       ct.product_name
from cte1 ct
where ranks1 = 1 ;
```

**Steps:**

##### First CTE (cte):
- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `customer_id` from the `sales` table with the `customer_id` in the `members` table to identify customers who became members.
- **WHERE** Clause only consider orders made before a customer's join date.
- **ROW_NUMBER( )** assigns a unique rank to each order per customer based on the order date.

##### Second CTE (cte1):
- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `product_id` from the first `CTE` with the `product_id` in the `menu` table to get the product names.
- **ROW_NUMBER( )** assigns a unique rank to each product per customer based on the descending order of the original rank (order by `ranks` desc). This will give the highest rank (most recent purchase) a rank of 1.

##### Final Select Statement:
- **WHERE** Clause selects only the rows where the rank (`ranks1`) is 1, indicating the last product purchased by each customer before joining as a member.

**Solution :**
customer_id|order_date|product_name
---|---|---
A|2021-01-01|curry
B|2021-01-04|sushi

***

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
with cte as 
(
	select
	       s.customer_id,
               s.order_date,
               s.product_id,
               me.join_date,
               m.product_name,
               m.price 
	from sales s
	join members me
	on s.customer_id = me.customer_id
	join menu m
	on s.product_id = m.product_id
	where s.order_date < me.join_date 
)
select
       customer_id,
       count(product_name) as total_products,
       sum(price) as total_amount_spent
from cte
group by customer_id;
```

**Steps:**

##### Common Table Expression (CTE):
- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `customer_id` from the `sales` table with `customer_id` in the `members` table to identify members and thier join date.
- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `product_id` from the `sales` table with `product_id` in the `menu` table to get product details (name and price).
- **WHERE** Clause only consider orders made before the customer's join date.

##### Final Select Statement:
- **Group by** Clause groups the table recored for each customer.
- **count(product_name)** function used to count the total number of products purchased by each customer before joining.
- **sum(price)** function used to calculate the total amount spent by each customer before joining.

**Solution :**
customer_id|total_products|total_amount_spent
---|---|---
A|2|25
B|3|40

**9. Join All The Tables and in separate column populate 'Y' if customer is member based on date of joining and 'N' if customer is not a member based on date of joining **

```sql
select
	s.customer_id,
	s.order_date,
	m.product_name,
	m.price,
	case when s.order_date >= ms.join_date
	then 'Y' else 'N' end as member 
from sales s                                                       
join menu m                                                         
on s.product_id = m.product_id                                      
left join members ms
on s.customer_id = ms.customer_id
```

**Steps:**

- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `product_id` from the `sales` table with `product_id` in the `menu` table to get product details (name and price).
- **LEFT JOIN** matchs the `customer_id` from the `sales` table with `customer_id` in the `members` table to get the membership join date. Used a left join to include all sales records, even if the customer is not a member.
-  Used a **CASE** statement to determine if the customer was a member at the time of purchase. If the `order_date` is on or after the `join_date`, mark as 'Y' (yes), otherwise 'N' (no).
-  **SELECT** columns_list including `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `price` and membership status (`member`).

**Solution :**
customer_id|order_date|product_name|price|member
---|---|---|---|---

**10. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**

```sql
with cte as
(
	select 
 	       s.customer_id,
	       s.order_date,
	       m.product_name,
	       m.price,
	       case when s.order_date >= ms.join_date 
	       then 'Y' else 'N' end as [members]
	from sales s                                                        
	join menu m                                                        
	on s.product_id = m.product_id                                     
	left join members ms
	on s.customer_id = ms.customer_id
)
select 
	customer_id,
	order_date,
	product_name,
	price,
	[members],
	case when [members] = 'N' then NULL 
	else DENSE_RANK() over(partition by customer_id,[members] 
	order by order_date) end as ranking
from cte;
```

**Steps:**

##### Common Table Expression (CTE):
- **INNER JOIN** matchs the `product_id` from the `sales` table with `product_id` in the `menu` table to get product details (name and price).
- **LEFT JOIN** matchs the `customer_id` from the `sales` table with `customer_id` in the `members` table to get the membership join date. Used a left join to include all sales records, even if the customer is not a member.
-  Used a **CASE** statement to determine if the customer was a member at the time of purchase. If the `order_date` is on or after the `join_date`, mark as 'Y' (yes), otherwise 'N' (no).
-  **SELECT** columns_list including `customer_id`, `order_date`, `product_name`, `price` and membership status (`member`).

##### Outer Query:
- **CASE** statement applies **DENSE_RANK( )** to rank orders only if the customer was a member at the time of purchase. If `[members]` is 'N', set `ranking` to NULL. Otherwise, partition by `customer_id` and `[members]`, and order by `order_date` to rank orders chronologically.



**Solution :**

customer_id|order_date|product_name|price|members|ranking
---|---|---|---|---|---
A	|2021-01-01|	sushi|	10|	N|NULL
